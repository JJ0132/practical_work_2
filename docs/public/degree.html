        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Computer engineering is a branch of electrical engineering which contains knowledge in electronics, electrical and computer to develop computer hardware and software. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, that can relate with AI, robotics, networks, architecture and OS.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="degree-hist">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>All started in 1939 with John Vicent and Clifford Berry developing the first electronic digital computer. The first personal computer emerged in 1970 with semiconductor technology and the first working transistor by Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain at Bell Labs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="degree-about">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>One must learn is mathematics such as calculus, lineal algebra and differential equations with computer science. Electric engineering is similar to computer in studies. Hardware engineers work with computer software systems and need computer programming education. It is important to keep up with advances in the technology, especially when needs to learning new skills or improving them.</p>
