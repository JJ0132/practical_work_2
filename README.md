## Explanation

This work constits in make a software development projects that involves a functional pages with basic things about HTML such as: basic CSS, hyperlinks, images, divs, classes, headers, footers and sections. 

+ The principal page expains what you can find navegating in the website and a brief explanation of each section.

+ The contact page is just a form, that does not script any submittion of any information, but is the basic structure of a contact form that can be found in almost most of the pages.

+ Net page contains hyperlinks to other websites done by other classmates, in this case there are 4 links.

+ The topic section contains some information about a topic selected, in my case I took cyptocurrencies, which were selected by our group for the practical work I.

+ Degree page involvs whole the degree that I am studying, computer engineering, it has, a brief explanation and the subjects that I studied, each with them own explanation and FCE as its own page with a more detailed review.

+ And the about page, here I talk about myself, introducting me a bit, telling some of my hobbies, a CV, two of my social media and some photos.

## Problems

I had some problems while I was uploading the files. I do not know if it is because I made the code in an distinct Virtual Studio Code windows, because if I am cloning a GitHub repository the extension to see the page in live does not work (the extension is called live server and it refreshes automaticly when I do any change in the HTML or in the CSS), and I later paste in the cloning VSCode or because is just a GitHub Pages bug. 

The problem can be notable when you commit an HTML file to the repo. It says that deployment failed and it does not charge the HTML to the website, so it does not seem like I do any change to the site.
I solved it by changing the file and commiting it again. There was an option to re-run the deployment but it does not work fine.

## Conclusion

Make an software project is not that hard, it is just needed time and the desire of make it. Maybe it complicates when it is done by groups, because there are more commits and changes that you do not really see, and can be more errors. 

Working with VSCode make me this work even easier, because with the extension Live Server I can see my website changing everytime, and the GitHub cloning function make the commits easier.
